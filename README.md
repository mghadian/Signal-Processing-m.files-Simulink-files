# Signal-Processing-m.files-Simulink-files
This folder contains the system design and signal processing algorithms that I generated for different projects in MATLAB.
## DBF
Comparison between different beamforming algorithms, from angular resolution POV. Smoothed MUSIC, MUSIC, ESPRIT and Conventional Beamforming (Beamscan) are compared together.

## INS implementation
Direct Implementation of GPS/INS navigation using ESKF (Error-state Kalman Filter) using IMU data with 100 Hz rate and GPS data with 1 Hz rate. While this code has been developed for ground-base vehicles, earth rotation effects have been ignored. 

## Stagger Design
PRI Staggering design to extend blind speed. Also, optimization of the coeficients ralated to the clutter cancelation filter is included in the m.file.

## Array Patterns
Tapering and Beamforming of a arbitary array. Taylor and Bayliss patterns are included. Also, array apperture using subarrays and tiles can be designed.
